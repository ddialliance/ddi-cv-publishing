# org.ddialliance:cvpublishing


This program needs two arguments:

1) The agency the dump is applied for, usually "DDI Alliance". Please remind that this should be put in quotes when containing whitespace. No encoding wanted

2) The path to the destination directory. The user needs write access to the destination directory.


A complete run will create a directory for each CV containing RDF, HTML, PDF and DDI-XML.
